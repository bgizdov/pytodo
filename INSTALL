Install
-------

From version 0.2 PyTodo depends on ElementTree library. If you are using
Python 2.4 or earlier grab it from here -
http://www.effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm or better from your distributor's
package repository. ElementTree is included in Python Standard Library as of
version 2.5, so no need to install.

From the source distribution, extract the tarball:

    tar zxvf pytodo-x.x.x.tar.gz

change directory:

    cd pytodo-x.x.x

and then run installation script with root privilege:

    python setup.py install
